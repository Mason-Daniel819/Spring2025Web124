<!--I adapted this project from Adapted from https://javascript30.com/ 5 flex panels gallery as well as https://javascript30.com/ 16 CSS Text Shadow Mouse Move Effect and https://javascript30.com/ 24 Sticky Nav to complete a working gallery website for my tattoo artist. I combined project 2, project 3 and project 5 and the lessons to improve this site. -->
<!--I struggled to get the nav top to log. I was thinking that I needed it to be a let variable so that if ebbed and flowed depending on browser settings. I learned that it needed to be a const variable. This was really cool and got me much closer to having a fully functional website for my artist. This has been a very cool series that has truly allowed me to grow and see what JS is capable of and why it would be used.-->
